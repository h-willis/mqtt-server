MQTT Broker Software Requirements Specification
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose

The goal is to implement a lightweight MQTT broker in Python, capable of handling basic MQTT operations such as connecting clients, subscribing to topics, publishing messages, and maintaining sessions.
1.2 Scope

    Support for MQTT v3.1.1 (optionally MQTT v5.0 later).
    Handle multiple clients concurrently.
    Implement Quality of Service (QoS) levels 0 and 1 (QoS 2 optional).
    Support basic authentication and access control.
    Provide logging and monitoring.
    Extensible for future enhancements (e.g., clustering, WebSockets).

2. Functional Requirements
2.1 Connection Handling

    Accept client connections over TCP.
    Support clean and persistent sessions.
    Handle keep-alive timeouts and disconnect inactive clients.

2.2 Publish/Subscribe Mechanism

    Clients can publish messages to topics.
    Clients can subscribe and unsubscribe from topics.
    Support wildcard topic subscriptions (+, #).
    Retain messages for new subscribers (optional feature).

2.3 Quality of Service (QoS)

    QoS 0: At most once delivery.
    QoS 1: At least once delivery with PUBACK.
    QoS 2 (optional): Exactly once delivery with PUBREC, PUBREL, and PUBCOMP.

2.4 Authentication & Security

    Support basic username/password authentication.
    Allow TLS encryption for secure communication.
    Implement access control lists (ACLs) for topic-level permissions (optional).

2.5 Session Management

    Support persistent sessions for reconnecting clients.
    Store unacknowledged messages for disconnected clients with QoS 1 and 2.

2.6 Retained Messages & Last Will

    Clients can publish retained messages to topics.
    Support "Last Will and Testament" (LWT) messages for client disconnection.

2.7 Logging & Monitoring

    Log client connections, disconnections, and errors.
    Monitor published messages and subscriptions.
    Provide a basic web interface or API for real-time monitoring (optional).

3. Non-Functional Requirements
3.1 Performance & Scalability

    Support at least 100 concurrent connections.
    Efficient message routing with minimal latency.
    Handle high-frequency messages without excessive CPU/memory usage.

3.2 Reliability & Fault Tolerance

    Ensure message delivery within defined QoS constraints.
    Avoid crashes due to malformed packets or incorrect client behavior.

3.3 Extensibility

    Modular architecture to support additional features like clustering, WebSockets, and database persistence.

3.4 Compliance

    Conform to MQTT v3.1.1 specifications.
    Follow best practices for Python-based network applications.
